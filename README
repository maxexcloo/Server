>> NOTES <<
Run on a freshly installed server under root! Be sure to enable the DotDeb repository for PHP-FPM support!
If you want to use the minimal script, run it first.
The server is initially configured with a root of /home/main/http, change it in /etc/nginx/sites-available/main.
No warranty. For help come on #Frantech on irc.dairc.net and look for maxexcloo!

For a basic server install \(NGINX + PHP\): bash server.sh basic
For a full install \(NGINX + PHP + MySQL + Exim\): bash server.sh full
